# Scribe-- Do once, repeat never.

Scribe is an collaborative AI workspace that automatically captures, organises and summerizes team discussions into structured knowledge.
It helps teams remember not just "what" was said, but "why" decisions were made.


## Why it matters
Most organizations lose critical context in scattered chats, calls, and documents over a long period of time.  
Scribe transforms this would be lost information into clarity. Making every decision, insight, and update easy to find, reuse, and build upon.

By automatically documenting and connecting related discussions, Scribe helps:
- Remote and hybrid teams avoid repetitive work.
- Project managers track reasoning behind decisions.
- Teams onboard new members faster with past context preserved. (repetition is reduced as firms onboard new members often).


### Who it's for
- Startups managing fast-paced collaboration.
- Product and Project Managers who need decision traceability.
- Knowledge-driven teams in design, research, or AI development.
- Organizations looking to retain institutional knowledge.
